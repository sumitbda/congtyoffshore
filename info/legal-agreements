                            us, Offshore Company Corp, and you, and is made effective as of the date of your first use
                            of this website ("this site") or the date of electronic acceptance. This agreement sets
                            forth the general terms and conditions of your use of this site and the products and
                            services purchased or accessed through this site (individually and collectively, the
                            "services"), and is in addition to (not in lieu of) any specific terms and conditions that
                            apply to particular services.</p>
                        <p>Whether you are simply browsing or using this site to purchase services, your use of this
                            site and your electronic acceptance of this agreement signifies that you have read,
                            understood, acknowledged and agreed to be bound by this agreement, along with the following
                            policies and the applicable product agreements, which are incorporated herein by
                            reference.</p>
                        <p>The terms "we", "us" and "our" shall refer to Offshore Company Corp. The terms "you" and
                            "your" shall refer to any individual or entity who accepts this agreement, has access to
                            your account or uses the services. Nothing in this agreement shall be deemed to confer any

                        <p>We may, in our sole and absolute discretion, change or modify this agreement, and any
                            policies or agreements which are incorporated herein, at any time, and such changes or
                            modifications shall be effective immediately upon posting to this site. Your use of this
                            site or the services after such changes or modifications have been made shall constitute
                            your acceptance of this agreement as last revised. If you do not agree to be bound by this
                            agreement as last revised, do not use (or continue to use) this site or the services. In

                            email. It is therefore very important that you keep your shopper account ("account")
                            information current. We assume no liability or responsibility for your failure to receive an
                            email notification if such failure results from an inaccurate email address.</p></div>

                            site at the time you order the services. We expressly reserve the right to change or modify
                            our prices and fees at any time, and such changes or modifications shall be posted on this
                            site and be effective immediately without need for further notice to you. If you have
                            purchased or obtained services for a period of months or years, changes or modifications in

                            further described below.</p>
                        <p>Except as prohibited in any product-specific agreement, you may pay for services by utilising
                            any of the following payment methods.</p>

                        <p>For services that offer "Express Checkout", clicking the Express Checkout button will
                            automatically place an order for that service and charge the primary payment method we have
                            on file for your account. Confirmation of that order will be sent to the email address we
                            have on file for your account. Your payment method we have on file must be kept valid if you
                            have any active services in your account.</p>
                        <p>You acknowledge and agree that where refunds are issued to your payment method, our issuance
                            of a refund receipt is only confirmation that we have submitted your refund to the payment
                            method charged at the time of the original sale, and that we have absolutely no control over
                            when the refund will be applied towards your payment method's available balance. You further
                            acknowledge and agree that the payment provider, and/or the individual issuing bank
                            associated with your payment method, establish and regulate the time frames for posting your
                            refund, and that such refund-posting time frames may range from five (5) business days to a
                            full billing cycle, or longer.</p>
                        <p>If you are being billed on a monthly basis, your monthly billing date will be based on the
                            date of the month you purchased the services, unless that date falls after the 28th of the
                            month, in which case your billing date will be the 28th of each month.</p>
                        <p>In order to ensure that you do not experience an interruption or loss of services, most
                            services offer an automatic-renewal option. The automatic-renewal option automatically
                            renews the applicable service for a renewal period equal in time to the most recent service
                            period. While the details of the automatic-renewal option vary from service to service, the
                            services that offer an automatic-renewal option treat it as the default setting. Therefore,
                            unless you disable the automatic-renewal option, we will automatically renew the applicable
                            service when it comes up for renewal, and will take payment from the payment method we have
                            on file for you, at our then current rates, which you acknowledge and agree may be higher or
                            lower than the rates for the original service period. You may enable or disable the
                            automatic-renewal option at any time. However, should you elect to disable the
                            automatic-renewal option, and you fail to manually renew your services before they expire,
                            you may experience an interruption or loss of service, and we shall not be liable to you or
                            any third party regarding the same.</p>
                        <p>In addition, we may participate in "recurring billing programs" or "account updater services"
                            supported by your credit-card provider (and ultimately dependent on your bank's
                            participation). If you are enrolled in an automatic-renewal option and we are unable to
                            successfully charge your existing payment method, your credit-card provider (or your bank)
                            may notify us of updates to your credit-card number and/or expiration date, or they may
                            automatically charge your new credit card on our behalf without notification to us. In
                            accordance with recurring billing program requirements, in the event that we are notified of
                            an update to your credit-card number and/or expiration date, we will automatically update
                            your payment profile on your behalf. We make no guarantees that we will request or receive
                            updated credit-card information. You acknowledge and agree that it is your sole
                            responsibility to modify and maintain your account settings, including, but not limited
                            to:</p>
                        <p>(i) setting your renewal options; and</p>
                        <p>(ii) ensuring your associated payment methods are current and valid.</p>
                        <p>Further, you acknowledge and agree that your failure to do so may result in the interruption
                            or loss of services, and we shall not be liable to you or any third party regarding the
                            same.</p>
                        <p>If for any reason we are unable to charge your payment method for the full amount owed for
                            the services provided, or if we receive notification of a chargeback, reversal or payment
                            dispute, or are charged a penalty for any fee we previously charged to your payment method,
                            you agree that we may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment,
                            including, but not limited to, immediate cancellation, without notice to you, of any
                            services registered or renewed on your behalf. We also reserve the right to charge you
                            reasonable administrative fees or processing fees for:</p>
                        <p>(i) tasks we may perform outside the normal scope of our services;</p>
                        <p>(ii) additional time and/or costs we may incur in providing our services; and/or</p>
                        <p>(iii) your non-compliance with this agreement (as determined by us in our sole and absolute
                            discretion).</p>
                        <p>Typical administrative or processing fee scenarios include, but are not limited to:</p>
                        <p>(i) customer service issues that require additional personal time or attention; and</p>
                        <p>(ii) recouping any and all costs and fees, including the cost of services, incurred by us as
                            a result of chargebacks or other payment disputes brought by you, your bank or
                            payment-method processor.</p>
                        <p>These administrative fees or processing fees will be charged to the payment method we have on
                            file for you.</p>
                        <p>We may offer product-level pricing in various currencies. However, transaction processing is
                            supported only in HKD (Hong Kong dollars) and a select number of currency options, as
                            displayed on this site ("supported currency" or "supported currencies"). If the currency
                            selected is a supported currency, the transaction will be processed in the supported
                            currency and the pricing displayed during the checkout process will be the actual amount
                            processed and submitted to your bank for payment. If the currency selected is not a
                            supported currency, the transaction will be processed in US dollars and the pricing
                            displayed during the checkout process will be an estimated conversion price at the time of
                            purchase. In either case (whether the currency selected is a supported currency or not), if
                            the transaction is processed in a currency that differs from the currency of your bank
                            account, you may be charged</p>
                        <p>exchange-rate conversion fees by your bank. In addition, due to time differences between:</p>
                        <p>(i) the time you complete the checkout process;</p>
                        <p>(ii) the time the transaction is processed; and</p>
                        <p>(iii) the time the transaction posts to your bank statement;</p>
                        <p>the conversion rates may fluctuate.</p>
                        <p>We make no representations or warranties that:</p>
                        <p>(a) the amount submitted to your bank for payment will be the same as the amount posted to
                            your bank statement (in the case of a supported currency); or</p>
                        <p>(b) the estimated conversion price will be the same as either the amount processed or the
                            amount posted to your bank statement (in the case of a</p>

                            discrepancies (including any and all claims for a refund based on the foregoing).</p>
                        <p>In addition, regardless of the selected currency, you acknowledge and agree that you may be
                            charged Value Added Tax ("VAT"), Goods and Services Tax ("GST"), or other local fees and/or

                        <p>At the beginning, we will only collect 1 USD of the total service fee as a deposit for your
                            order. The remainder of the service fee will be captured when the full service is delivered.
                            This remaining service fee needs to be authorised, and we will request an electronic
                            authorisation from the cardholder's issuing bank.</p>
                        <p>If you pay by PayPal account, the remainder of the service fee will be charged to your
                            credit/debit card.</p>
                        <p>We can re-authorise your credit card if you order extra services from us.</p>
                        <p>You are fully responsible for making sure your credit/debit card can cover the remaining fee.
                            If your credit-/debit-card account does not have sufficient funds, the service may be
                            delayed.</p>
                        <p>After receiving the sale order and purchase order, the financial team/department will fully
                            authorise the service fee for your order from your credit/debit card to guarantee the
                            payment will be done. If the credit in your account is not enough, after 15 calendar days,
                            we will not refund.</p>
                        <p>We will refund the full deposit to you within 7 days if we cannot provide/deliver the
                            services.</p>
                        <h3>9.5. CURRENCY CONVERSION</h3>
                        <p>We use USD (US dollar) as the list price for all our services.</p>
                        <p>Complying with Government requirement, the price of services and products must be converted
                            into HKD (Hong Kong dollar) for any payment made by credit card and SGD (Singapore dollar)
                            for any payment by PayPal with a credit card.</p>
                        <p>For transactions involving a currency conversion, rates are derived from the mid-market rate,
                            which is the midpoint between the "buy" and "sell" rates from global currency markets
                            (exchange rate fixed at 1USD = 7.8 HKD and 1USD = 1.45 SGD).</p>
                        <p>See the mid-market rate at
                            https://finance.yahoo.com/currency-converter/#from=USD;to=HKD;amt=1 and
                            https://finance.yahoo.com/currency-converter/#from=USD;to=SGD;amt=1.</p>
                        <p>The rate may differ due to currency conversion with your local currency.</p>
                        <p>Your credit-card statement might show HKD (Hong Kong dollar) or SGD (Singapore dollar),
                            depending on the payment method you selected.</p>
                        <p>This term applies only to the credit-card payment option, not for other options like PayPal
                            account or wire transfer/telephonetransfer.</p></div>
