                            <div class="toggle-content"><p>First and foremost, it is essential to define the term
                                Offshore. Offshore relates to managing, registering, conducting, or operating in a
                                foreign country, often with financial, legal and tax benefits.&#160;</p>
                                <p>An offshore company has a variety of uses and benefits for clients wishing to engage
                                    in international financial trade and investment activities. Depending on the
                                    specific offshore jurisdiction, an offshore company may have the following features
                                    and advantages: Ease of Incorporation, Minimal Fees, No Foreign Exchange Controls,
                                    High Confidentiality, Tax Benefits</p>

                            <div class="toggle-content"><p>Jurisdictions not only have some aspects of tax benefits,
                                they are also good places to attract investors because of factors such as stable
                                politics, good reputation and sophisticated corporate law.</p>
                                <p>Each offshore country has its separate benefits that can meet customers’ strategic
                                    demands. OCC’s customer service team are trained to support clients to find out the
                                    applicable tax havens for their business.</p>
                                <p>We carefully list the service countries on our website, from the lower-fee countries
                                    to higher ones. Although there is some difference in fees, all of the jurisdictions

                                    countries with high-ranking currencies, clients will be introduced to Hong Kong and
                                    Singapore, which are well placed to attract businessmen due to their significant

                            <div class="toggle-content"><p>An offshore company may be of interest to a great number of
                                people, and it may be used for various activities.</p>
                                <h2>Businessmen</h2>
                                <p>Creating an offshore company allows you to begin an activity without having to deal
                                    with setting up a complicated infrastructure. An offshore company allows you to
                                    quickly create a stable structure with a simple administration and enjoy all the
                                    benefits of the offshore jurisdiction.</p>
                                <h2>Commerce over the internet (e-commerce)</h2>
                                <p>Internet traders can use an offshore company to maintain a domain name and to manage
                                    internet sites. An offshore company might be ideal for people whose business is on
                                    the internet. You might choose to incorporate the registered office of your company
                                    in an offshore jurisdiction to take advantage of the various benefits offered by
                                    these jurisdictions.</p>
                                <h2>Consultants/counsellors</h2>
                                <p>You can also carry on your consultancy or counselling business through an offshore
                                    company. You will find it easier to manage your company, while being registered in a
                                    stable jurisdiction and benefiting from all the strengths of that jurisdiction.</p>
                                <h2>International business</h2>
                                <p>International commerce can be carried out through an offshore company. It will handle
                                    purchases and sales operations. One IBC can also obtain a VAT number for companies
                                    that we register in Cyprus or in the United Kingdom.</p>
                                <h2>Holding intellectual property rights</h2>
                                <p>Any kind of intellectual property right (a patent or trademark) may be registered in
                                    the name of an offshore company. The company may also buy or sell this type of
                                    right. It may also grant rights of use to third parties in return for payments.</p>
                                <h2>For the custody of movable and immovable property</h2>
                                <p>Offshore companies are used to hold both movable property (such as yachts) and
                                    immovable property (such as houses and buildings). In addition to confidentiality,
                                    the benefits and advantages they offer include exemption from certain types of taxes
                                    (e.g. inheritance tax). It should be noted, however, that some countries do not
                                    allow the acquisition of movable/immovable property through offshore structures and
                                    therefore those wishing to form an offshore structure are advised to check with a
                                    competent authority before proceeding.</p>
                                <h2>For inheritance purposes</h2>
                                <p>An offshore firm that always stays afloat (provided all costs associated with running
                                    it are paid) may, in some countries, be used as a means of avoiding inheritance-tax
                                    laws. With a view to minimising inheritance-tax liability, the offshore structure
                                    may also be combined with a trust or a foundation.</p>
                                <h2>Stockbroker/forex</h2>
                                <p>Offshore companies are very often used for share dealing or foreign-exchange
                                    transactions. The main reasons being the anonymous nature of the transaction (the
                                    account can be opened under a company name).</p>
                                <p>You are free to make international money transfers under your Offshore Company. We
                                    wish to make you aware that you ought to liaise with a tax advisor in your country
                                    of residence before setting up an offshore company.</p></div>

                                Delaware, only tax profits made within the jurisdiction, whereas Cyprus charges a 10%
                                flat tax. While a company may not be subject to tax reporting to its local authorities,
                                from a personal standpoint it mustn’t relieve you from seeking counsel from a tax

                            <div class="toggle-content"><p>For better recognition on L.L.C and Corporation, let's take
                                Google and YouTube for example</p>
                                <p>Google is a Corporation and YouTube is an L.L.C. Why did they choose different entity
                                    types? The L.L.C vs Corporation distinction is clearly defined by this one example
                                    that the new generation of entrepreneurs should take full take advantage of.</p>
                                <p>YouTube actually started as a corporation, filing its Certificate of Incorporation
                                    with the Delaware Division of Corporations on October 3, 2005. On November 8, 2006,
                                    just 13 months and five days later, it merged its Corporation into an L.L.C, which
                                    is one of the key advantages of Delaware companies: they can change from one form of
                                    entity to another, whenever they want.</p>
                                <p>YouTube L.L.C, on the other hand, is owned by a few members. Nobody but the insiders
                                    know how few, and nobody but the insiders know who the owners are. In addition,
                                    nobody but the owners know what the company finances are, because no public
                                    disclosure is required. That’s the benefit of a Delaware L.L.C—your members, their
                                    ownership percentages and your financial valuation are private matters, of which
                                    only the company insiders are aware. There is no public registration, no public
                                    disclosure and no federal requirement of any type that necessitates the owners of a
                                    Delaware L.L.C to reveal who they are on the public record.</p>
                                <p>Google chose to be a Delaware Corporation so it could go public and raise money,
                                    which they did on August 16, 2004. Once it did so, it quickly became one of the
                                    richest companies in history. Google's rise to power created tens of thousands of
                                    millionaires and a lot of billionaires. Even though 60% of Google is owned by
                                    institutions, there are millions of individual shareholders in the company. The
                                    company has current cash reserves of $50 billion.</p></div>

                                EIN). Just as having a social security number is important for US citizens, the Federal
                                Tax ID Number is necessary for an LLC or corporation to lawfully conduct business
                                activities, especially if you're operating a business in the United States. All US
                                companies are required to have an EIN to open a US bank account, obtain loans, hire
                                employees and more. The EIN is valid for the life of the company. However, if your
                                business changes its entity type (for example, it changes from an LLC to a corporation),
                                a new Federal Tax ID Number is typically required.</p>

                            <div class="toggle-content"><p>A Delaware LLC (Delaware limited liability company) is a type
                                of business entity that is created by filing the proper certificate of formation with
                                the Delaware Secretary of State.</p>
                                <p>So why form a Delaware LLC? The Delaware LLC is a truly unique business format in
                                    that the structure of the company and the rules that govern its members are
                                    contained in a contract called an operating agreement, which is drafted by the
                                    company's members (owners). In drafting the operating agreement, you have what
                                    lawyers call ‘freedom of contract’, which means that, as the owner, you have the
                                    freedom to tailor the terms and rules of your LLC to accommodate your specific
                                    business needs. Once signed and agreed to by all parties, the operating agreement is
                                    legal and enforceable by all parties.</p>
                                <p>When you form your Delaware LLC through OffShore Company Corp, our corporate kit,
                                    which is included in both the standard and premium packages, will provide you with
                                    an operating agreement to customise to your specific business needs.</p></div>

                                (LLC)?
                            </div>
                            <div class="toggle-content"><p>An LLC is a relatively new type of entity in the United
                                States. If properly structured, it combines the limited liability of a corporation with
                                the pass-through taxation of a partnership. However, it is important to clarify that
                                while LLCs can be treated as partnerships, they are not corporations.</p>
                                <p>An LLC is a business vehicle with a legal existence separate and distinct from its
                                    owners. Owners and managers are not personally liable for the company's debts and
                                    obligations. These features, when combined with non-U.S. source income, mean
                                    non-resident aliens of the United States can avoid U.S. taxation when using an
                                    LLC.</p>
                                <h2>LLC Operating Agreement</h2>
                                <p>The operations and management of an LLC are governed by a written agreement, composed
                                    by its owners, called an LLC Operating Agreement. The Delaware Limited Liability
                                    Company Act allows the parties to define their operations, management and business
                                    relationship in the LLC Operating Agreement. This is known as freedom of
                                    contract.</p>
                                <p>An LLC guarantees secure confidentiality as well as the ability to create a
                                    customized management structure that establishes the economic relationship among
                                    owners. The LLC Operating Agreement can be written in any language and is typically
                                    not required to be translated into English.</p>
                                <h2>How to Manage an LLC</h2>
                                <p>While the Delaware LLC law permits a Delaware LLC to be managed by its members, it
                                    does not require members to be managers. More importantly, the law also states that
                                    no member or manager is personally responsible for any debts, obligations or
                                    liabilities of the Delaware LLC solely by being a member or acting as a manager.</p>

                            <div class="toggle-content"><p>With minimal start-up requirements, simple maintenance and
                                the ability for members to establish their own company structures and rules, the
                                Delaware LLC is the most flexible type of business entity offered by any state or
                                country in the world</p>
                                <p>Below are seven of the significant benefits of a standard Delaware LLC:</p>
                                <h2>Advantage # 1: Custom LLC Business Structure and Rules</h2>
                                <p>This means the terms and rules of each LLC can be tailored to accommodate the
                                    specific needs and preferences of an LLC. This is the biggest benefit of an LLC over
                                    any other form of business entity. This power is called freedom of contract.</p>
                                <h2>Advantage # 2: Asset Protection Against Creditors</h2>
                                <p>Delaware LLCs possess increased asset protection against creditors. This means that
                                    if a member of an LLC has a judgment filed against him/her, a creditor cannot attack
                                    the LLC nor acquire any portion of the LLC's assets. This benefit protects everyone
                                    in the company</p>
                                <h2>Advantage # 3: Statuary Limitation on Member Personal Liability</h2>
                                <p>A statutory limitation on the personal liability of the members of an LLC means that
                                    members are not held liable for repayment if an LLC fails and leaves behind debt.
                                    They just lose the amount of dollar they invested in the LLC.</p>
                                <h2>Advantage # 4: Beneficial Tax Treatment by the IRS</h2>
                                <p>When an LLC is formed, the owners can choose whether they want the LLC to be taxed as
                                    a partnership, an S corporation, a C corporation or a sole proprietorship.
                                    Single-member LLCs are not recognized by the IRS and therefore pay no taxes at
                                    all.</p>
                                <h2>Advantage # 5: Simple Start-Up and Minimal Requirements</h2>
                                <p>Very little information is required to form an LLC in Delaware, and start-up involves
                                    only a small filing fee. Additionally, there are no meetings or voting
                                    requirements.</p>
                                <h2>Advantage # 6: Low Annual Fees and Simple Maintenance</h2>
                                <p>The cost to maintain a Delaware LLC is simple and inexpensive. Once a year, a simple
                                    form and an annual Franchise Tax Fee of $300 must be filed with the Delaware
                                    Secretary of State, and a Registered Agent Fee must be paid annually, as all
                                    Delaware LLCs are required by law to have a Registered Agent to accept service of
                                    process.</p>
                                <h2>Advantage # 7: Delaware LLC Privacy</h2>
                                <p>You are not required to disclose any information about the owner of an LLC to the
                                    state of Delaware in order to form or maintain an LLC. In Delaware, you are required
                                    only to have a designated contact person and a Delaware Registered Agent.</p></div>

                            <div class="toggle-content"><p><strong>A general corporation</strong>&#160;– often referred
                                to as a stock corporation, open corporation or C corporation – is highly recommended
                                when a company goes public or plans a private offering of stock. General corporations
                                are also typically used when a company wants to attract venture-capital funding.</p>
                                <p><strong>A general corporation</strong>&#160;has three tiers of power – shareholders,
                                    directors and officers. Each has different rights and responsibilities within the
                                    corporation.</p>
                                <p><strong>Shareholders</strong>provide the financial resources in the company. They own
                                    the company but do not manage its routine. Holders of common stock receive one vote
                                    for each share they own, and they have the right to help elect the members of the
                                    board of directors, as well as to vote on certain other matters of major
                                    significance to the company.</p>
                                <p><strong>The shareholder</strong>&#160;who holds a majority of the shares of issued
                                    stock also holds the right to control the company. They are sometimes referred to as
                                    majority shareholders. They possess a larger amount of responsibility than minority
                                    shareholders.</p>
                                <p><strong>Other shareholders who</strong>&#160;hold no controlling role are referred to
                                    as minor shareholders. Generally, they bear no responsibility to the company. They
                                    are able to assign or grant their votes to anyone they choose, and sell their stocks
                                    at will.</p>
                                <p><strong>Shareholders</strong>&#160;are rewarded in two ways – by dividends paid on
                                    their stocks and by the increased value of their stocks as the company grows.</p>
                                <p><strong>Directors</strong>&#160;take responsibility for the company’s overall
                                    management. They manage all the major business actions, such as the issuance of
                                    stock, the election of officers, the hiring of key management, the establishment of
                                    corporate policies and the setting of their own and key officers' salaries and
                                    compensation packages.</p>
                                <p><strong>Directors</strong>&#160;may make decisions and take action in pre-announced
                                    meetings with a quorum present, or without a meeting by unanimous written consent of
                                    all directors. Directors cannot give or sell their votes to other directors, nor can

                                <p>Ordinarily, directors may be removed and replaced – with or without cause – by the
                                    majority vote of the shareholders. This is the controlling role of majority

                                <p>The officers work for the board of directors and handle the day-to-day business
                                    activity. Officers carry out the board's decisions and implement the board's policy.
                                    Officers are usually the President, Vice President, Secretary and Treasurer. The
                                    board of directors will appoint other officers such as CEO, Sale Manager, Operation
                                    Manager etc, to fit the company provision.</p>
                                <p>Officers do have the right to purchase company-issued stocks at the discretion of the
                                    board of directors.</p>

                                requirements are that the company has to register its business with the Business
                                Registration Office of the IRD and to furnish profits tax returns issued to it.</p>
                                <p>If the company has profits chargeable to tax for any year of assessment but has not
                                    received any return from the IRD, it has to inform the IRD in writing of its
                                    liability within 4 months after the end of the basis period for that year of
                                    assessment.</p>
                                <p>Furthermore, the company is required to keep sufficient records (in English or
                                    Chinese) to enable its assessable profits to be readily ascertained and the records
                                    must be retained for at least seven years after the completion of the relevant

                                    20%. Any salary a director receives will be liable for income tax, National
                                    Insurance and employers&rsquo; NI contributions. However, directors are often also
                                    shareholders. This means they are treated as employees of their own company. The
                                    distribution of profits to directors can be done in such a way that much of the
                                    money they receive is not subject to corporation tax or personal income tax.</p>

                                    carry on a profession or trade.<br> Just two LLP members are required to be held
                                    liable for filing LLP accounts and other secretarial duties.<br> If the LLP's
                                    members are not resident in the UK and the income of the LLP is derived from a
                                    non-UK source, then neither the LLP nor its members will be subject to UK taxation.
                                    So LLPs in the UK bring together a number of benefits.</p>

                                <p>Consequently, an LLP in the UK is characterised by being a very flexible body for

                            <div class="toggle-content"><p><strong>Capital Requirements</strong></p>
                                <p>A private company must have a minimum issued share capital of €1,164.69. 20% of this
                                    amount must be paid up on incorporation. Any foreign convertible currency may be
                                    used to denominate this capital. The chosen currency will also be the company’s
                                    reporting currency and the currency in which tax is paid and any tax refund due is
                                    received, a factor which eliminates foreign exchange risks. Furthermore, Maltese
                                    company law provides for companies set up with a variable share capital.</p>
                                <p><strong>Shareholders</strong></p>
                                <p>Whilst companies are generally set up with more than one shareholder, there is the
                                    possibility to set up a company as a single member company. Various persons or
                                    entities may hold shares, including individuals, corporate entities, trusts and
                                    foundations. Alternatively, a trust companiy such as Chetcuti Cauchi's Claris
                                    Capital Limited, our trust company which has been authorised by the Malta Financial
                                    Services Authority to act as trustee or fiduciary, may hold shares for the benefit
                                    of the beneficiaries.</p>
                                <p><strong>Objects</strong></p>
                                <p>The objects of a private limited company are unlimited but must be specified in the
                                    Memorandum of Association. In case of a Private exempt limited company, a primary
                                    purpose must be stated as well.</p>
                                <p><strong>Directors and Secretary</strong></p>
                                <p>With respect to directors and company secretary, private and public companies have
                                    different requirements. While private companies must have a minimum of one director,
                                    a public company must have a minimum of two. It is also possible for a director to
                                    be a body corporate. All companies are obliged to have a company secretary. A
                                    company secretary must be an individual and there is a possibility for a director to
                                    act as a company secretary. In the case of private exempt companies, a sole director
                                    may also act as the company secretary.</p>
                                <p>While there are no legal requisites regarding the residence of directors or the
                                    company secretary, it is advisable to appoint Malta resident directors as this
                                    ensures that the company is managed effectively in Malta. Our professionals are able
                                    to act as or recommend officers for client companies under our administration.</p>
                                <p><strong>Confidentiality</strong></p>
                                <p>Under the Professional Secrecy Act, professional practitioners are bound by a high
                                    standard of confidentiality as established by the aforementioned act. These
                                    practitioners include advocates, notaries, accountants, auditors, trustees and
                                    officers of nominee companies and licensed nominees, amongst others. Section 257 of
                                    the Maltese Criminal Code stipulates that professionals who disclose professional
                                    secrets may be liable to a maximum fine of € 46,587.47 and/or a 2 year prison
                                    sentence.</p>
                                <p><strong>Meetings</strong></p>
                                <p>Malta companies are required to hold at least one general meeting every year, with
                                    not more than fifteen months elapsing between the date of one annual general meeting
                                    and that of the next. A company which holds its first annual general meeting is
                                    exempt from holding another general meeting in the year of its registration or in
                                    the following year.</p>
                                <p><strong>Formation Procedure</strong></p>
                                <p>To register a company, the memorandum and articles of association must be presented
                                    to the Registrar of Companies, along with the evidence that the paid up share
                                    capital of the company has been deposited in a bank account. Afterwards a
                                    certificate of registration will be issued.</p>
                                <p><strong>Incorporation Time-Scale</strong></p>
                                <p>Malta companies benefit from a relatively swift incorporation process which takes
                                    between 3 to 5 days once all information, receipt of due diligence documents and
                                    remittance of funds have been has been provided. For an additional fee, a company
                                    may be registered within just 24 hours.</p>
                                <p><strong>Accounting &amp; Accounting Year</strong></p>
                                <p>Yearly audited financial statements need to be prepared in accordance with
                                    International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). These statements must be filed
                                    with the Registry of Companies where they may be inspected by the public.
                                    Alternatively, Maltese law provides for a choice of financial year-end.</p></div>

                            <div class="toggle-content"><p>Companies registered in Malta are considered to be resident
                                and domiciled in Malta, thus they are subject to tax on their worldwide income less
                                permitted deductions at the corporate income tax rate which at present stands at
                                35%.</p>
                                <p><strong>Imputation System</strong></p>
                                <p>Maltese tax resident shareholders receive full credit for any tax paid by the company
                                    on profits distributed as dividends by a Maltese company, thus preventing the risk
                                    of double taxation on that income. In cases where the shareholder is liable to tax
                                    in Malta on dividend at a rate which is lower than the company rate of tax (which
                                    currently stands at 35%), excess imputation tax credits are refundable.</p>
                                <p><strong>Tax Refunds</strong></p>
                                <p>Upon receipt of a dividend, shareholders of a Malta company may claim a refund of all
                                    or part of the Malta tax paid at the level of the company on such income. In order
                                    to determine the amount of refund which one may claim, the type and source of the
                                    income received by the company must be considered. Shareholders of a company that
                                    have a branch in Malta and who are receiving dividends out of branch profits subject
                                    to tax in Malta qualify for the same Malta tax refunds as shareholders of a Malta
                                    company.</p>
                                <p>Maltese law stipulates that refunds are to be paid within 14 days from the day in
                                    which a refund becomes due, that is when a complete and correct tax return for the
                                    company and shareholders has been filed, the tax due has been fully paid and a
                                    complete and proper refund claim has been made.</p>
                                <p>Refunds may not be claimed in any case on tax suffered on income derived directly or

                                <p>Shareholders who claim double taxation relief in respect of any foreign income
                                    received by a Malta company are limited to a 2/3 refund of the Malta tax paid.</p>
                                <p><strong>The 6/7ths refund</strong></p>
                                <p>In cases of dividends which are paid to shareholders out of any other income which

                                    refund of 6/7ths of the Malta tax paid by the company. Thus, shareholders will
                                    benefit from an effective rate of Malta tax of 5%.</p></div>

                                <p>To date, Malta has signed over 70 double tax treaties. Most treaties are based on the

                                    investors is limited, as long as a holding satisfies the criteria for the exemption
                                    outlined below:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>it is resident or incorporated in the EU;</li>
                                    <li>it is subject to any foreign tax at a rate of at least 15%; or</li>
                                    <li>less than 50% of its income is derived from passive interest or royalties.</li>

                                <p>The above are the safe harbours set. In cases where the company in which the
                                    participating holding is held does not fall within one of the aforementioned safe
                                    harbours, the income which is derived therefore may nevertheless be exempt from tax
                                    in Malta if both the conditions below are satisfied:</p>
                                <ul>

                                        to tax at a rate which is not less than 5%

                                    burden when doing business in EU and in the world in general.</p>
                                <p>2) Good local market: Netherlands is one of the most prosperous regions in the world
                                    offering a local market with very good potential.</p>
                                <p>3) Excellent Transportation network: Netherlands has perhaps the most important ports
                                    and transportation hubs in Europe.</p></div>

                                significant than the previous one, is the flexible procedure for issue of shares. Now
                                voting and distribution of rights related to profit are optional. Therefore the private
                                LLC can manage more efficiently its Shareholders’ interests and general social
                                objectives. Shares can be separated into classes, depending on the rights and the level
                                of the Shareholders. In addition, the BV Act allows the denomination of shares in

                                    and a quick incorporation process. Moreover, Cyprus has a wide double tax treaty

                                <p>For example if you consider the case of any un-conditional businesses such as general
                                    consultancy, no special license is required. On the other hand any sort of food or
                                    cosmetics related business, though unconditional may require some special licenses.
                                    For example a whole sale food import business will require a food import license
                                    issued by the ministry of health. A similar license is required to setup and operate
                                    a restaurant or food processing facility.</p>
                                <p>In the case of conditional business, most of these require additional licenses. For
                                    example investors looking to setup up educational institutions, require a special
                                    education license from the department of education. Retail trading also requires a
                                    special retail trading license issued by the department of industry and trade.</p>
                                <p>It should be noted that for both conditional as well as unconditional business, these
                                    special licenses can only be obtained after an investment registration certification
                                    and enterprise registration certificate have been issued. A good rule of thumb is to
                                    examine the licensing laws for a particular business in your own country along with
                                    the required criteria. Generally something of a similar nature will be applicable in
                                    Vietnam.</p>

                                    additional licenses. Furthermore in certain cases where the investor may not be able
                                    to meet certain conditions, we can suggest practical solutions or workarounds to
                                    overcome the more stringent requirements.</p></div>
